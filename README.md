# Fuzzy geolocation Proof of Concept
At the 2020 [W3C Maps for the Web workshop](https://www.w3.org/2020/maps/), Geonovum launched an initiative to improve privacy and security when accessing online mapping and geodata resources and services, by adding fuzziness to geolocation.

TODO: add link to presentation as soon as available online.

This repository is intended to contain:
1. documentation on how to use OGC APIs
1. code for a live demonstrator
1. code for a sample broker that adds fuzziness
